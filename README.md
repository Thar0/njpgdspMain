# njpgdspMain

This repository contains a documented disassembly of the N64 JPEG decoder RSP code used in a couple of N64 titles. In particular, this was disassembled from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

It builds the following:
`1cab4dc7403c218956adc82dffc624c0  njpgdspMain.text.bin`
`cf5303b2528507dad6da93df2a52a01f  njpgdspMain.rodata.bin`
`njpgdspMain.o`

A single-file version of the [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips) assembler is included to facilitate building and easy integration into decompilations or other projects.
